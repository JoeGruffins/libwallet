# libwallet

libwallet is a go library for dcr. It includes features for creating new wallets,
restoring wallets from seed and synchronizing using SPV (Simple Payment Verification).
SPV is a simple, lightweight but privacy-preserving means of fetching blockchain
information that is relevant to a wallet.
